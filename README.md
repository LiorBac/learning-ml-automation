# Machine Learning & Python Automation - One Month Learning Journey

This repository documents my one-month intensive self-study plan, focusing on:

- **Week 1: Basics**  
  Python fundamentals: syntax, data structures, file handling, small automation scripts.  

- **Week 2: Machine Learning**  
  Intro to ML concepts with `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.  
  Covers regression, classification, and small ML experiments.  

- **Week 3: Automation**  
  Using Python to automate workflows: files, Excel, APIs, web scraping.  
  Ends with a practical automation project.  

- **Week 4: PyTorch & Final Project**  
  Deep learning with PyTorch: tensors, training models, building neural networks.  
  Wraps up with a **final project** that combines automation + ML.
